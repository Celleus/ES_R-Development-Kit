### Validation of connectivity: with/without the USB dongle
When developing your own software with ES_R-DevelopmentKit-android, you have 2 choices regarding how to connect JINS MEME ES_R with an Android device. One way is to use the official USB(BLE) dongle, and the other way is a direct connection with BLE chip embedded in the Android device. If you use the official USB dongle, please check supported(validated) android OS and devices [here](https://github.com/jins-meme/ES_R-DataLogger-for-Android).

* It seems that direct connection on Android OS 6 doesn't work correctly (edited 6.Jun.2016).
